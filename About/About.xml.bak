    <description>A simple mod that adds Valyrian steel, a high-grade material meant to make the highest-tier weapons and armor. Inspired by the material of the same name in Game of Thrones.
        
A batch of 10 Valyrian steel requires, in total: 100 steel, 50 uranium, 20 gold, 3 human hearts, and 2500 work. Crafted at the Smithy.

It can very rarely spawn in veins of 1 to 3, yielding one unit of Valyrian steel per.

Originally intended for personal use. Probably unbalanced, use at your own risk. Willing to update for balance and tweaks in the future. Open to suggestions.
